#Whitespaces in Perl
=begin
A Perl program does not care about whitespaces. 
Following program works perfectly fine âˆ’
=cut
print       "Hello, world\n";
#output Hello, world


#But if spaces are inside the quoted strings, then they would be printed as is. 
print "Hello
          world\n";
#output Hello
#			world
